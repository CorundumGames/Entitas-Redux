	/// the context to ensure that only one entity with this component exists.
	/// E.g. context.isAnimating = true or context.SetResources();
	/// [MyContextName, MyOtherContextName]: You can make this component to be
	/// available only in the specified contexts.
	/// The code generator can generate these attributes for you.
	/// More available Attributes can be found in Entitas.CodeGeneration.Attributes/Attributes.
